<div id="FAQs">
<h1 class="question"> What is MySoapBox?</h1>
<p class="answer">
Everyone wants to be heard.  But getting your message in front of an audience can be a challenge.  At other sites like Reddit you can 
can make a post and maybe it'll be seen.  Or more likely, it'll be buried.  You can say what you want on your Facebook and Twitter, 
but who sees that other than your existing friends?  On MySoapBox, we have gathered the audience for you.  With thousands of viewers 
every single day, your message is sure to be heard.  Wanna give your take on Coke vs. Pepsi?  Or wish your friend a happy birthday?  
Maybe exhibit your poetry, link us to your band's music, voice your political views, or even bash your ex?  Whatever you want to say, 
you can say it here.  Our entire page is dedicated to one thing and one thing only: your message.
</p>
<h1 class="question"> How does it work?</h1>
<p class="answer">
It's simple.  Craft your message and provide a brief description.  People can then view your description and provide support for your message.  
If at the end of the day your message receives the most support, the following day it will be prominently displayed on the front page for 
everyone to see.
</p>
<h1 class="question"> Are there limits to what I can say?</h1>
<p class="answer">
Good question.  The short answer is, "I don't know."  Let's see how this plays out.  We want to allow this to be as free as possible, but 
maybe don't post links, blatant advertisements, viruses, pornography, or personal information.
